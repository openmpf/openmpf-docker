Welcome to the Open Media Processing Framework (OpenMPF) Docker Project!

## What is the OpenMPF?

OpenMPF provides a platform to perform content detection and extraction on bulk multimedia, enabling users to analyze,
search, and share information through the extraction of objects, keywords, thumbnails, and other contextual data.

OpenMPF enables users to build configurable media processing pipelines, enabling the rapid development and deployment of
analytic algorithms and large-scale media processing applications.

### Search and Share

Simplify large-scale media processing and enable the extraction of meaningful content

### Open API

Apply cutting-edge algorithms such as face detection and object classification

### Flexible Architecture

Integrate into your existing environment or use OpenMPF as a standalone application

## Overview

This repository contains code for the OpenMPF Dockerfiles and related files.

## Getting Started

### Install and Configure Docker

Download and install Docker for your OS
[here](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download).

We recommend that you allocate extra system resources to Docker before executing the build steps. This is especially
important because the build requires a large amount of memory and will likely fail if it does not have enough. We
recommend that you allocate the Docker daemon 4 CPU cores, 10240 MB (10 GB) of memory (you may be able to get away with
less but this is what we have been successful with), and 4096 MB (4 GB) of disk swap space.

#### Check the Linux Host Storage Driver

The [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/select-storage-driver/)
recommends using the overlay2 storage driver for Linux hosts over the devicemapper storage driver. In general, the
devicemapper storage driver does not perform well in production environments. When installing Docker on Linux, check
which storage driver Docker chose by default:

- `docker info | grep Storage`

If this prints out `Storage Driver: overlay2` then nothing more needs to be done. Instead, if it prints
out `Storage Driver: devicemapper`, then we recommend changing it. Refer to
the [Change the Linux Host Storage Driver to overlay2](#optional-change-the-linux-host-storage-driver-to-overlay2)
section.

#### Install Docker Compose

If you installed Docker for Mac or Docker for Windows, then `docker compose`
should already be included. If you are installing on Linux, install the `docker-compose-plugin`
package using your distribution's package manager. If the `docker-compose-plugin` package is not
available for your distribution, then follow the instructions
[here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/cli-command/#install-on-linux)


#### Other Programs

If you installed Docker for Windows, then please install a program that allows you to run bash scripts in a Unix-like
terminal environment. We recommend Git Bash, which is part of [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/), or
[Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/install.html).

### Pull or Build the OpenMPF Docker Images

The recommended way to get started is to follow the steps in the "Quick Start" section of the documentation for the
OpenMPF Workflow Manager image on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/openmpf/openmpf_workflow_manager). That will
instruct you to pull and deploy prebuilt runtime images. If you wish to customize your deployment then skip ahead to
the [Configure Users](#optional-configure-users) section and the [Configure HTTPS](#optional-configure-https) section.

Otherwise, the rest of this section will describe the process for building the OpenMPF Docker images. Note that this
process can take an hour or more if you're starting from scratch.

#### Build Setup

Clone the [openmpf-projects repository](https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-projects) somewhere on your host system:

- `git clone https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-projects.git --recursive`
- (Optional) checkout a branch or commit
    - `cd openmpf-projects`
    - `git checkout <branch or commit>`
    - `git submodule update --init`

If you plan to develop and integrate your own component into OpenMPF, then please refer to
the [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

#### Create the OpenMPF Build Image

<span id="docker-build-command"></span>
Run the following command from within the `openmpf-projects/openmpf-docker` directory to create the OpenMPF build image:

- `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build -f openmpf_build/Dockerfile .. -t openmpf_build`

#### Build the OpenMPF Component Executor Docker Images

<span id="component-executors-build-commands"></span>

Run the commands in this section from within the `openmpf-docker/components` directory.

Run the following command to create the OpenMPF C++ component build image:

- `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build . -f cpp_component_build/Dockerfile -t openmpf_cpp_component_build`

Run the following command to create the OpenMPF C++ component executor image:

- `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build . -f cpp_executor/Dockerfile -t openmpf_cpp_executor`

Run the following command to create the OpenMPF Java component build image:

- `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build . -f java_component_build/Dockerfile -t openmpf_java_component_build`

Run the following command to create the OpenMPF Java component executor image:

- `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build . -f java_executor/Dockerfile -t openmpf_java_executor`

Run the following command to create the OpenMPF Python component build image:

- `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build . -f python/Dockerfile --target build -t openmpf_python_component_build`

Run the following command to create the OpenMPF Python component executor image:

- `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build . -f python/Dockerfile --target executor -t openmpf_python_executor`

Run the following command to create the OpenMPF Python component executor single stage build(SSB) image:

- `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build . -f python/Dockerfile --target ssb -t openmpf_python_executor_ssb`

#### Generate docker-compose.yml

From within the `openmpf-docker` directory, copy `env.tpl` to `.env` and set environment variables in `.env`. Make sure
that `OPENMPF_PROJECTS_PATH` is set correctly.

The default user password settings are public knowledge, which could be a security risk. To configure your own user
settings, see the
[Configure Users](#optional-configure-users) section.

Leave the `KEYSTORE_` variables in `.env`  blank when configuring the Workflow Manager to use HTTP. To enable HTTPS, see
the
[Configure HTTPS](#optional-configure-https) section.

Run the following command to generate a stand-alone `docker-compose.yml` file:

```
docker compose \
   -f docker-compose.core.yml \
   -f docker-compose.components.yml \
   config > docker-compose.yml
```

Optionally, you can make further customizations to the `docker-compose.yml` file by generating it with your
own `docker-compose.custom.yml` file as follows:

```
docker compose \
   -f docker-compose.core.yml \
   -f docker-compose.components.yml \
   -f docker-compose.custom.yml \
   config > docker-compose.yml
```

Note that you should run all of the `docker compose` commands described in the following sections from the same
directory that contains the `docker-compose.yml` file you just generated.

#### Build the OpenMPF Runtime Docker Images

If you built the runtime images before, then run the following command to remove the old containers and volumes:

- `docker compose down -v`

Run the following command to create the new runtime images:

- `docker compose build`

### Run OpenMPF using Docker Compose

Once the runtime images are pulled or built, and you have a `docker-compose.yml` file, you can run OpenMPF using:

- `docker compose up`

Note that if you want to run more than one instance of a service type, you will need to use the `--scale` option. For
example:

- `docker compose up --scale east-text-detection=2 other_service=3`

The output from each of the services will be piped to the terminal. Wait until you see a line similar to the following
generated by the Workflow Manager container:

> INFO: Server startup in 26967 ms

#### Log into the Workflow Manager

You can reach the Workflow Manager at the following URL:

`http://<ip-address-or-hostname-of-docker-host>:8080`

After logging in, you can see which components are registered by clicking on the "Configuration" dropdown from the top
menu bar and then clicking on "Component Registration".

#### Monitor the Containers

Show the containers running on the current node:

- `docker ps`

#### Tearing Down the Containers

When you are ready to stop the OpenMPF deployment, you have the following options:

**Persist State**

If you would like to persist the state of OpenMPF so that the next time you run `docker compose up` the same job
information, log files, custom property settings, custom pipelines, etc., are used, then press ctrl+c in the same
terminal you ran `docker compose up`. That will stop the running containers.

Alternatively, you can run the following command in a different terminal:

- `docker compose stop`

Both approaches preserve the Docker volumes.

**Clean Slate**

If you would like to start from a clean slate the next time you run `docker compose up`, as though you had never
deployed OpenMPF before, then run the following command from within the `openmpf-docker` directory:

- `docker compose down -v`

This will remove all of the OpenMPF Docker containers, volumes, and networks. It does not remove the Docker images.

**Remove All Images**

To remove all of the OpenMPF Docker containers, volumes, networks, and images, then run the following command from
within the `openmpf-docker` directory:

- `docker compose down -v --rmi all`

### (Optional) Docker Swarm Deployment

OpenMPF can be deployed in a distributed environment if you would like to take advantage of running the project, and
scheduling jobs, across multiple physical or virtual machines. The simplest way to do this is to set up a Docker Swarm
deployment. If you would like a walkthrough on how to do that, please see the
[Swarm Deployment Guide](SWARM.md).

### (Optional) CLI Runner

The [OpenMPF Command Line Runner (CLI runner)](CLI_RUNNER.md) allows users to run jobs with a single component without
the Workflow Manager.

### (Optional) Configure Users

Create a copy of
`openmpf-projects/openmpf/trunk/workflow-manager/src/main/resources/properties/user.properties` ([link](https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf/blob/master/trunk/workflow-manager/src/main/resources/properties/user.properties))
and make modifications to that file to modify the default users and add new users. Follow the instructions in one of the
following two sections.

#### (Option A) Modify docker-compose.yml

If you already have a stand-alone `docker-compose.yml` file then run the following command to combine it with
`docker-compose.users.yml` ([link](https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-docker/blob/master/docker-compose.users.yml)):

```
cp docker-compose.yml docker-compose.yml.orig
docker compose \
   -f docker-compose.yml.orig \
   -f docker-compose.users.yml \
   config > docker-compose.yml
```

Replace `${USER_PROPERTIES_PATH}` in `docker-compose.yml` with the location of the `user.properties` file. In a Docker
Compose deployment this is a path on file system of the host that will be running the `openmpf_workflow_manager`
container. In a Docker Swarm deployment this is a path on the file system of the swarm manager host.

#### (Option B) Generate docker-compose.yml

If you're generating your own stand-alone `docker-compose.yml` file then set the `USER_PROPERTIES_PATH`
variable in the `.env` file to the location of the `user.properties` file. In a Docker Compose deployment this is a path
on file system of the host that will be running the `openmpf_workflow_manager` container. In a Docker Swarm deployment
this is a path on the file system of the swarm manager host.

Run the following command to generate the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```
docker compose \
   -f docker-compose.core.yml \
   -f docker-compose.users.yml \
   -f docker-compose.components.yml \
   config > docker-compose.yml
```

If configuring your deployment with HTTPS, you will also need to add `-f docker-compose.https.yml` to the above command.

### (Optional) Configure HTTPS

The Workflow Manager web application can be configured to use HTTPS. The Java JKS and PKCS#12 keystore formats are
supported. Follow the instructions in one of the following two sections.

#### (Option A) Modify docker-compose.yml

If you already have a stand-alone `docker-compose.yml` file then run the following command to combine it with
`docker-compose.https.yml` ([link](https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-docker/blob/master/docker-compose.https.yml)):

```
cp docker-compose.yml docker-compose.yml.orig
docker compose \
   -f docker-compose.yml.orig \
   -f docker-compose.https.yml \
   config > docker-compose.yml
```

Replace `${KEYSTORE_PATH}` in `docker-compose.yml` with the location of keystore file. In a Docker Compose deployment
this is a path on file system of the host that will be running the `openmpf_workflow_manager` container. In a Docker
Swarm deployment this is a path on the file system of the swarm manager host.

Also, replace `${KEYSTORE_PASSWORD}` in `docker-compose.yml` with the password for accessing the keystore.

#### (Option B) Generate docker-compose.yml

If you're generating your own stand-alone `docker-compose.yml` file then set the `KEYSTORE_PATH` variable in the `.env`
file to the location of the keystore file. In a Docker Compose deployment this is a path on file system of the host that
will be running the `openmpf_workflow_manager` container. In a Docker Swarm deployment this is a path on the file system
of the swarm manager host.

Also, set `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` in the `.env` file with the password for accessing the keystore.

Run the following command to generate the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```
docker compose \
   -f docker-compose.core.yml \
   -f docker-compose.https.yml \
   -f docker-compose.components.yml \
   config > docker-compose.yml
```

If configuring your deployment with custom user password settings, you will also need to
add `-f docker-compose.users.yml` to the above command.

### (Optional) Import Root Certificates for Additional Certificate Authorities

The Workflow Manager, Markup, and component containers can be configured to trust additional
certificate authorities. The containers use these certificates when acting as an HTTPS client. For
example, the Workflow Manager will use the certificates when downloading remote media and when
sending job status callbacks.

To import additional root certificates add an entry for `MPF_CA_CERTS` to a service's environment
variables in `docker-compose.core.yml`. `MPF_CA_CERTS` must contain a colon-delimited list of
absolute file paths. Each entry in `MPF_CA_CERTS` will be added to the container's trust store.
This feature is intended to be used with a volume mounted to the container containing the
certificates, but the paths can refer to any path the container has access to (e.g. Docker configs,
secrets, and bind mounts).


### (Optional) Use Secrets for Environment Variables

1. Create a secret. This can be done in the compose file with the
  [`secrets` top-level element](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/09-secrets/). If you
  are using Docker Swarm, you can also create the secret by running
  [`docker secret create ...`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/secret_create/).
2. [Add a secret to the service.](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/05-services/#secrets)
3. Add an environment variable to the service. The name should be the name of the environment
  variable you want to set with `_LOAD_FROM_FILE` appended. The value should be the path where the
  secret is mounted in the container. Secrets are mounted at `/run/secrets/<secret_name>` by
  default.

Below is an example of a partial Docker Compose file that shows how a user could set the
`KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` environment variable using a secret. The password for the keystore is
`changeit`. The `keystore_password.txt` file is created using `printf` so a trailing new line is
not added.
```bash
printf 'changeit' > keystore_password.txt # Step 1
```
```yaml
services:
  workflow-manager:
    environment:
      KEYSTORE_PASSWORD_LOAD_FROM_FILE: /run/secrets/keystore_password # Step 3
    secrets:
      - keystore_password # Step 2
secrets:
  keystore_password: # Step 1
    file: keystore_password.txt
```


### (Optional) Use Kibana for Log Viewing and Aggregation

To use [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/kibana) to view OpenMPF logs, you will need to add `-f docker-compose.elk.yml` to
your
`docker compose config` command. After running `docker compose up`, Kibana can be accessed at
`http://<ip-address-or-hostname-of-docker-host>:5601`. Kibana comes with many apps, but the only ones likely to be
useful are Logs (`http://<ip-address-or-hostname-of-docker-host>:5601/app/infra#/logs`)
and Discover (`http://<ip-address-or-hostname-of-docker-host>:5601/app/kibana#/discover`).

If you have Docker configured to use a non-standard root directory, then you will need to change the volume
configuration for the filebeat service in `docker-compose.elk.yml` from
`/var/lib/docker/containers:/var/lib/docker/containers:ro` to
`/path/to/docker-dir/containers:/var/lib/docker/containers:ro`.

If you have Docker configured to use a non-standard location for the Docker socket, then you will need to change the
volume configuration for the filebeat service in `docker-compose.elk.yml` from
`/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro` to
`/path/to/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro`.

### (Optional) Add GPU support with NVIDIA CUDA

To run OpenMPF components that use the NVIDIA GPUs, you must ensure that the host OS of the GPU machine has version 9.1
or higher of the NVIDIA GPU drivers installed. To install the drivers, please see the full instructions
[here](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html).

Once you have the drivers installed on the host OS, you need to install the NVIDIA Docker runtime. Follow
[this](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-container-runtime/blob/master/README.md#centos-distributions)
installation guide.

To get the nodes in your swarm cluster to use the NVIDIA Docker runtime, you will need to update
the `/etc/docker/daemon.json` file on each node. If that file does not already exist, then create it. Add the following
content:

```
{
    "default-runtime": "nvidia",
    "runtimes": {
        "nvidia": {
            "path": "/usr/bin/nvidia-container-runtime",
            "runtimeArgs": []
        }
    }
}
```

This setting will affect every container running on the node, which, in general, should not cause any problems for
containers that don't require a special runtime.

After you launch OpenMPF with the NVIDIA runtime specified, you need to login and go to the Properties page under
Configuration in the top menu bar, then set the `detection.cuda.device.id property` to 0, or the CUDA index of your GPU
device.

### (Optional) Running Tests

Build the `openmpf_cpp_component_build`, `openmpf_cpp_executor`, and `openmpf_python_executor`
images as directed [above](#component-executors-build-commands). Then, from within the `openmpf-docker` directory run:

```shell script
docker build -f openmpf_build/Dockerfile path/to/openmpf-projects -t openmpf_build --build-arg RUN_TESTS=true
export COMPOSE_FILE='docker-compose.integration.test.yml:docker-compose.components.yml'
docker compose build --build-arg RUN_TESTS=true
docker compose up --exit-code-from workflow-manager
docker compose down -v
unset COMPOSE_FILE
```

### (Optional) Restrict Media Types That a Component Can Process

Component services can be configured to only process certain types of media. This is done by setting a component
service's `RESTRICT_MEDIA_TYPES` environment variable in `docker-compose.components.yml` to a comma-separated list
containing one or more of `VIDEO` , `IMAGE`, `AUDIO`, `UNKNOWN`. If you want different instances of a particular
component to process different media types, you can add multiple entries for that component
to `docker-compose.components.yml`. For example:

```yaml
services:
  ocv-face-detection-image-only:
    <<: *detection-component-base
    image: ${REGISTRY}openmpf_ocv_face_detection:${TAG}
    build: ${OPENMPF_PROJECTS_PATH}/openmpf-components/cpp/OcvFaceDetection
    environment:
      <<: *common-env-vars
      RESTRICT_MEDIA_TYPES: IMAGE

  ocv-face-detection-image-video-only:
    <<: *detection-component-base
    image: ${REGISTRY}openmpf_ocv_face_detection:${TAG}
    build: ${OPENMPF_PROJECTS_PATH}/openmpf-components/cpp/OcvFaceDetection
    environment:
      <<: *common-env-vars
      RESTRICT_MEDIA_TYPES: VIDEO, IMAGE

  # This instance will process all media types
  ocv-face-detection:
    <<: *detection-component-base
    image: ${REGISTRY}openmpf_ocv_face_detection:${TAG}
    build: ${OPENMPF_PROJECTS_PATH}/openmpf-components/cpp/OcvFaceDetection
```

### (Optional) Change the Linux Host Storage Driver to overlay2

The following steps assume that you've installed Docker Community Edition (CE) on a CentOS 7 host. If you installed
Docker Enterprise Edition (EE), and/or are using a different flavor of Linux, then refer to the official
steps [here](https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/overlayfs-driver/).

First check that you're running at least version 3.10.0-514 of higher of the Linux kernel:

- `uname -r`

If you're running an older version of the kernel then consider upgrading your system. Next, check the root partition:

- `df -hT`

This will print some output. For example:

```
Filesystem                                    Type      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/mapper/centos-root                       xfs        50G  8.5G   42G  17% /
devtmpfs                                      devtmpfs  3.9G     0  3.9G   0% /dev
tmpfs                                         tmpfs     3.9G     0  3.9G   0% /dev/shm
tmpfs                                         tmpfs     3.9G  417M  3.5G  11% /run
tmpfs                                         tmpfs     3.9G     0  3.9G   0% /sys/fs/cgroup
/dev/sda1                                     xfs       497M  305M  192M  62% /boot
/dev/mapper/centos-home                       xfs        87G  5.1G   82G   6% /home
```

Here we see that the root partition is mounted to `/` and has type `xfs`. In order to use overlay2 on an xfs filesystem,
the d_type option must be enabled. To check that run:

- `xfs_info <mount_point>`

For example:

```
[root@somehost ~]# xfs_info /
meta-data=/dev/mapper/centos-root isize=256    agcount=4, agsize=3276800 blks
         =                       sectsz=512   attr=2, projid32bit=1
         =                       crc=0        finobt=0 spinodes=0
data     =                       bsize=4096   blocks=13107200, imaxpct=25
         =                       sunit=0      swidth=0 blks
naming   =version 2              bsize=4096   ascii-ci=0 ftype=0
log      =internal               bsize=4096   blocks=6400, version=2
         =                       sectsz=512   sunit=0 blks, lazy-count=1
realtime =none                   extsz=4096   blocks=0, rtextents=0
```

Here we see that `ftype=0`. That means d_type is not enabled, so if you wish to use overlay2 you will need to recreate
the root partition with that option enabled. See
[here](http://www.pimwiddershoven.nl/entry/docker-on-centos-7-machine-with-xfs-filesystem-can-cause-trouble-when-d-type-is-not-supported)
.

Once you've determined that your Linux setup can support overlay2, stop Docker:

- `sudo systemctl stop docker`

Edit `/etc/docker/daemon.json`. If that file does not already exist, then create it. Assuming it's empty, add the
following content:

```
{
  "storage-driver": "overlay2"
}
```

Next, start Docker:

- `sudo systemctl start docker`

Check that the correct storage driver is now in use:

- `docker info | grep Storage`

This should now print out `Storage Driver: overlay2`. Repeat these steps on each of your Docker nodes.
