# OpenMPF Docker

Welcome to the Open Media Processing Framework (OpenMPF) Docker Project!

## What is the OpenMPF?

OpenMPF provides a platform to perform content detection and extraction on bulk multimedia, enabling users to analyze, search, and share information through the extraction of objects, keywords, thumbnails, and other contextual data.

OpenMPF enables users to build configurable media processing pipelines, enabling the rapid development and deployment of analytic algorithms and large-scale media processing applications.

### Search and Share

Simplify large-scale media processing and enable the extraction of meaningful content

### Open API

Apply cutting-edge algorithms such as face detection and object classification

### Flexible Architecture

Integrate into your existing environment or use OpenMPF as a standalone application

## Overview

This repository contains code for the OpenMPF Dockerfiles and related files.

## Getting Started

### With Docker

OpenMPF can be build and deployed using Docker. In order to do this, clone the
[Openmpf-docker repository](https://github.com/openmpf/openmpf-docker). Once
cloned (and assuming you have docker installed), you can run the following
command to build the OpenMPF project inside a docker container tagged as
mpf_build:latest `docker build mpf_build/ -t mpf_build:latest`. This container
will take a while to build, but once it is complete, you can run
`docker-compose build` and `docker-compose up` to run the project.
